# Near Earth Object Detection

## Final Project in Machine Learning/Data Science Fall 2025

In this study, the team analyzed and developed an improved machine learning pipeline
for classifying hazardous NEOs. By refining models introduced by the SOTA with engineered
features and careful tuning, classification accuracy was increased. Variables such as
“mag_x_diameter” capture nonlinear features, helping the model recognize interaction between
size and orbital eccentricity and variability in orbital radius’s effect on hazard likelihood.
Furthermore, the proposed MLP is the second-best model for this task, suggesting the
exploration of more deep learning approaches. The team’s work demonstrates that
preprocessing data can significantly enhance early detection capabilities and drive strategic
efforts for safety.
